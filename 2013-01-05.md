# Day One

First entry. Wanting to log my daily work. Not sure how this will go or what 
format it will take, but text brain dumps in txt files 
are always a great place to start.

## Progressive Enhancement Fail

Frustrating to have sublimevideo be down for the entire day. I didn't dig in to 
this myself, but learned the importance of having the native fallbacks ready. 
+1 for progressive enhancement.

## diy-client

Working towards getting this module browser compatible before working on some 
usage screencasts for diy.org. The one snag I am hitting is a deep dependency 
making an assumption about port number defaults and appends my dev port for 
every AJAX request. There are aging pull requests that fix this and other 
CORS issues. I should just fork the repo and call it a day, but it's a node core 
shim `http-browserify` that complicates things *I think*. Probably just 
pshycing myself out. I'd like to use the same exact code for the server and 
browser, but it's looking like that might not be the easiest option.

## Simple Deploys

Our deploys are pretty simple: `git push {env} master`, but they're still a 
disruption.

* Merge pull request in to upstream [10-15min]
* Production build commit [1min]
* Push to stage [1min]
* Push to prod [2min]

Rough estimations, but it's enough time to pull me out of my flow when I need 
to deploy changes for others which can sometimes happen multiple times a day.

I think automating everything after the pull request would be sweet. Have a 
deployment server that has clones of all services updated on a post merge hook 
in to master (assuming master is always "gold"). Once updated the deployment 
server handles building for production and sits on that. A web ui can display 
build status and buttons for deploying to stage or production. This allows 
anyone to deploy and all I have to do is review a pull request. Obviously 
nothing new. It's just one step away from continuous integration, but our test 
coverage isn't there to where that's a viable option for right now.

## Email

Email is shitty, but apostle.io has been super helpful in wrangling all the 
authoring of our transactional emails. It doesn't help rendering bugs in all 
the email clients out there which is a nightmare. Using litmus for testing 
which is shaping up to be a really helpful tool. The email designs are pretty 
basic so there isn't too much to fix, but enough to put a nice dent in tomorrow.
